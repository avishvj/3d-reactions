# 3d-reactions
Repo for my master's thesis.

To be completed later. Include:
- Versions for: Python, Conda, PyT + PyTG, Windows
- Install .yml file
- Stuff to compare to existing models
- Notebooks: mention creating ipython kernels corresponding to .yml
- Info about work e.g. building on MIT model
- Submodules: ts_gen. 
    - Reminder: if making submodule changes, check out a branch, make changes, publish change within submodule (ts_gen), then update superproject (3d-reactions) to reference new commit. 
    - Will have to come back to making MIT TF version work in this project.
